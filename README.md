## My process

### Built with

Pure HTML
CSS
Flexbox

### What I learned

I consolidated knowledge about the alignment of div elements on the page.

### Continued development

I should consolidate my markup knowledge and practice more. I need to work more with CSS units, especially rem, vh etc.

### Useful resources
